Testing quotonic build with meson

Add shields for python versions passing, docs passing, wheels building

Upon release, add dynamic badges from [shields.io](https://shields.io/), these may include commit activity or those specific to PyPI. 
Also, get cibuildwheels to build wheels for all platforms (see what SciPy decided to do), or just use build on all platforms like for Windows.
